 Merge Calculation
 */

/*
    A program which will calculate the total number of bars needed
    to merge from one heat to the next, taking into account the
    different amount of cuts on the bed, and whether there is
    a single, or multiple, re-rolls.

    Use confirm function for multiple re-rolls. "Are there any rerolls"

    Can also use variable % 2 === 0 to determine if there are subs in the cut on the bed.

    Need to prompt to ask if there are any subs in the bundling station
