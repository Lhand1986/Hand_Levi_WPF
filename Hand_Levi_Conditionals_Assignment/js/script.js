/*
    Create a calculator which calculates how many stops you would have to make
    during a long trip. The outcome is dictated by what variety of vehicle you
    are using, whether it is a car with an average distance of 300 miles per
    tank of gas, or a motorcycle with an average distance of 150 miles per
    tank of gas. Also, the calculator will take into account what percentage
    of a full tank you currently possess.
